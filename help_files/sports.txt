Rafael Nadal is the player who usually makes history at the French Open given his 11 titles but rival Novak Djokovic got his name into the record books too when he swept past Jan-Lennard Struff 6-3 6-2 6-2.
Serbian world No. 1 Djokovic -- who awaits Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals -- became the first man to make 10 straight French Open quarterfinals. Nadal likely would have matched him had he not been forced to pull out in the third round in 2016 with a wrist injury.
In another milestone, 17-year-old Amanda Anisimova became the youngest female quarterfinalist at the French Open since Martina Hingis in 1998 after topping Spanish qualifier Aliona Bolsova 6-3 6-0.
Up next is defending champion Simona Halep, who advanced in similar fashion, 6-1 6-0 in 45 minutes over 18-year-old Wimbledon junior champion Iga Swiatek.
Showman Monfils has admittedly become more focused towards the latter stages of his career, realizing that at 32 time is indeed running out.
And unusually for him at a grand slam, he didn't drop any sets through three rounds. There was plenty of energy left on the eve of the much anticipated clash with Thiem.
